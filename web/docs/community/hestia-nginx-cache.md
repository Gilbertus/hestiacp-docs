This project is a WordPress plugin that automatically purges the Nginx cache after you make a website change such as updating a post or changing your theme. You also have the ability to manually purge the cache using a button in the WordPress admin bar.

It uses the latest Hestia API, with Access keys. As such, it requires Hestia >= 1.6.0.
